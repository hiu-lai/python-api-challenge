2) This time of the year shows, 20 North and 20 South are where some of our hottest cities are located.
3) With r-squared being 0.8 for Northern Hemisphere between Maximum Temperature and Latitude suggest a correlation between the two. Meaning the closer you are to the equator the warmer it would be. However, the r-squared for Southern Hemisphere of 0.23 suggest a weak correlation.
